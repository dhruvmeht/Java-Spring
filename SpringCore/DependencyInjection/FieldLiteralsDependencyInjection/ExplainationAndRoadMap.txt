Spring Dependency Injection for Literals :- 

Dependency injection can be done in two ways(via xml approach) :- 

1.) Setter Injection
Setter injection takes place when IOC container at the time of loading the beans.xml file finds the property tag. It searches out for the setter method for that appropriate literal/Property/field variable. 

2.) Constructor injection 
Constructor Injection takes place when IOC container at the time of loading the beans.xml file finds the constructor-args tag. At the time of creating a bean, IOC container will search for the appropriate constructor containing the required field arguments. 
Note :- By Default the Data Type of the Constructor-arg/property field value is String. Spring framework internally calls its conversion method to convert the data type based on the defined constructor parameters. 


Road Map :- 

Engine - Its an interface containing two methods startEngine() and driverCar()

PetrolEngine - Its an implementation class to Engine Interface, overriding the methods of the interface.
		It will have two fields called manufacturer and EngineHorsePower.

DieselEngine - Its an implementation class to Engine Interface, overriding the methods of the interface.
		It will have two fields called manufacturer and EngineHorsePower.

TestDrive - Its a main method class which will rely on the spring beans to call its appropriate methods.
